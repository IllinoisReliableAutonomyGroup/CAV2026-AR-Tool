\section{Background: Rendering and Abstract Rendering}
\label{sec:background}

A  Gaussian Splat scene is defined by a collection of Gaussians in 3D space, and each Gaussian is $4$-tuple with a  mean position  $\mu_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$, a covariance shape matrix $\Sigma_i$, a color $c_i$, and an opacity $\alpha_i$. A rendering algorithm takes  a scene and a camera pose and computes the  color for each pixel in a 2D image as follows: (1) each Gaussian center \(\mu_i\) is transformed into the camera frame using the camera extrinsics; (2) the Gaussians are projected from camera coordinates to the 2D image plane via the camera intrinsics; (3) Gaussians are depth-sorted along the viewing direction; and (4) colors are blended in that order using a cumulative sum of products of colors and opacities. The blending implements volumetric compositing: closer, opaque Gaussians dominate a pixel; distant or transparent Gaussians contribute proportionally less.

Abstract rendering over-approximates every stage above with piecewise-linear relational bounds~\cite{AbstractRendering_Neurips2025}. Each geometric transform (world \(\to\) camera, camera \(\to\) image) and each per-pixel blend is replaced by a relation that encloses all possible function outputs for the given input sets of poses and scenes.
An abstract rendering-like algorithm for simpler mesh-based scenes was introduced~\cite{Habeeb-AbstractImages24}.
