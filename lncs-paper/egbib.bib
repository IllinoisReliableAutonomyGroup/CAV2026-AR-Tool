abstract = {We propose functional adversarial attacks, a novel class of threat models for crafting adversarial examples to fool machine learning models. Unlike a standard ℓp-ball threat model, a functional adversarial threat model allows only a single function to be used to perturb input features to produce an adversarial example. For example, a functional adversarial attack applied on colors of an image can change all red pixels simultaneously to light red. Such global uniform changes in images can be less perceptible than perturbing pixels of the image individually. For simplicity, we refer to functional adversarial attacks on image colors as ReColorAdv, which is the main focus of our experiments. We show that functional threat models can be combined with existing additive (ℓp) threat models to generate stronger threat models that allow both small, individual perturbations and large, uniform changes to an input. Moreover, we prove that such combinations encompass perturbations that would not be allowed in either constituent threat model. In practice, ReCol-orAdv can significantly reduce the accuracy of a ResNet-32 trained on CIFAR-10. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, combining ReColorAdv with other attacks leads to the strongest existing attack even after adversarial training.},

abstract={Deep learning, as an important topic of artificial intelligence, has been widely applied in various fields, especially in computer vision applications, such as image classification and object detection, which have made remarkable advancements. However, it has been demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) suffer from adversarial vulnerability. For the image classification task, the carefully crafted perturbations are added to the clean images, and the resulting adversarial examples are able to change the prediction results of DNNs. Hence, the presence of adversarial examples presents a significant obstacle to the security of DNNs in practical applications, which has garnered considerable attention from researchers in related fields. Recently, a number of studies have been conducted on adversarial attacks. In this survey, the relevant concepts and background are first introduced. Then, based on computer vision tasks, we systematically review the existing adversarial attack methods and research progress. Finally, several common defense methods are summarized, and some challenges are discussed.},

PROVEN provides probability certificates of neural network robustness when the input perturbation follow distributional characterization. Notably, PROVEN is derived from current state-of-the-art worst-case neural network robustness verification frameworks, and therefore it can provide probability certificates with little computational overhead on top of existing methods such as Fast-Lin, CROWN and CNN-Cert. Experiments on small and large MNIST and CIFAR neural network models demonstrate our probabilistic approach can tighten up robustness certificate to around $1.8 \times$ and $3.5 \times$ with at least a $99.99%$ confidence compared with the worst-case robustness certificate by CROWN and CNN-Cert.}

abstract = {Numerical abstract domains are a fundamental component in modern static program analysis and are used in a wide range of scenarios (e.g. computing array bounds, disjointness, etc). However, analysis with these domains can be very expensive, deeply affecting the scalability and practical applicability of the static analysis. Hence, it is critical to ensure that these domains are made highly efficient. In this work, we present a complete approach for optimizing the performance of the Octagon numerical abstract domain, a domain shown to be particularly effective in practice. Our optimization approach is based on two key insights: i) the ability to perform online decomposition of the octagons leading to a massive reduction in operation counts, and ii) leveraging classic performance optimizations from linear algebra such as vectorization, locality of reference, scalar replacement and others, for improving the key bottlenecks of the domain. Applying these ideas, we designed new algorithms for the core Octagon operators with better asymptotic runtime than prior work and combined them with the optimization techniques to achieve high actual performance. We implemented our approach in the Octagon operators exported by the popular APRON C library, thus enabling existing static analyzers using APRON to immediately benefit from our work. To demonstrate the performance benefits of our approach, we evaluated our framework on three published static analyzers showing massive speed-ups for the time spent in Octagon analysis (e.g., up to 146x) as well as significant end-to-end program analysis speed-ups (up to 18.7x). Based on these results, we believe that our framework can serve as a new basis for static analysis with the Octagon numerical domain.},

Such properties are clearly safety properties since the behaviour of a C program is undefined after a RTE. When it analyses a program of the class for which it is specialised, Astr{\'e}e is far more precise than general purpose static analysers. Nevertheless, for safety and industrial reasons, the small number of false alarms first produced by the tool must be reduced down to zero by a new fine tuned analysis.

abstract = {Abstract Synthesizing photo-realistic images and videos is at the heart of computer graphics and has been the focus of decades of research. Traditionally, synthetic images of a scene are generated using rendering algorithms such as rasterization or ray tracing, which take specifically defined representations of geometry and material properties as input. Collectively, these inputs define the actual scene and what is rendered, and are referred to as the scene representation (where a scene consists of one or more objects). Example scene representations are triangle meshes with accompanied textures (e.g., created by an artist), point clouds (e.g., from a depth sensor), volumetric grids (e.g., from a CT scan), or implicit surface functions (e.g., truncated signed distance fields). The reconstruction of such a scene representation from observations using differentiable rendering losses is known as inverse graphics or inverse rendering. Neural rendering is closely related, and combines ideas from classical computer graphics and machine learning to create algorithms for synthesizing images from real-world observations. Neural rendering is a leap forward towards the goal of synthesizing photo-realistic image and video content. In recent years, we have seen immense progress in this field through hundreds of publications that show different ways to inject learnable components into the rendering pipeline. This state-of-the-art report on advances in neural rendering focuses on methods that combine classical rendering principles with learned 3D scene representations, often now referred to as neural scene representations. A key advantage of these methods is that they are 3D-consistent by design, enabling applications such as novel viewpoint synthesis of a captured scene. In addition to methods that handle static scenes, we cover neural scene representations for modeling non-rigidly deforming objects and scene editing and composition. While most of these approaches are scene-specific, we also discuss techniques that generalize across object classes and can be used for generative tasks. In addition to reviewing these state-of-the-art methods, we provide an overview of fundamental concepts and definitions used in the current literature. We conclude with a discussion on open challenges and social implications.},

abstract="Providing safety guarantees for autonomous systems is difficult as these systems operate in complex environments that require the use of learning-enabled components, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), for visual perception. DNNs are hard to formally verify due to their size (they can have billions of parameters), lack of formal specifications, and sensitivity to slight changes in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, the high-dimensional inputs to the DNNs come from sensors such as high-fidelity cameras that are themselves complex and hard to model -- they bear complex relationships to the system states and are subject to random environmental perturbations. We present a survey of verification techniques that aim to provide quantitative or qualitative formal guarantees for such autonomous systems.",

abstract="Neural Networks (NNs) have increasingly apparent safety implications commensurate with their proliferation in real-world applications: both unanticipated as well as adversarial misclassifications can result in fatal outcomes. As a consequence, techniques of formal verification have been recognized as crucial to the design and deployment of safe NNs. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to formally verify the most commonly considered safety specifications for ReLU NNs -- i.e. polytopic specifications on the input and output of the network. Like some other approaches, ours uses a relaxed convex program to mitigate the combinatorial complexity of the problem. However, unique in our approach is the way we use a convex solver not only as a linear feasibility checker, but also as a means of penalizing the amount of relaxation allowed in solutions. In particular, we encode each ReLU by means of the usual linear constraints, and combine this with a convex objective function that penalizes the discrepancy between the output of each neuron and its relaxation. This convex function is further structured to force the largest relaxations to appear closest to the input layer; this provides the further benefit that the most ``problematic'' neurons are conditioned as early as possible, when conditioning layer by layer. This paradigm can be leveraged to create a verification algorithm that is not only faster in general than competing approaches, but is also able to verify considerably more safety properties; we evaluated PEREGRiNN on a standard MNIST robustness verification suite to substantiate these claims.",

abstract="In this paper, we consider the problem of formally verifying a Neural Network (NN) based autonomous landing system. In such a system, a NN controller processes images from a camera to guide the aircraft while approaching the runway. A central challenge for the safety and liveness verification of vision-based closed-loop systems is the lack of mathematical models that captures the relation between the system states (e.g., position of the aircraft) and the images processed by the vision-based NN controller. Another challenge is the limited abilities of state-of-the-art NN model checkers. Such model checkers can reason only about simple input-output robustness properties of neural networks. This limitation creates a gap between the NN model checker abilities and the need to verify a closed-loop system while considering the aircraft dynamics, the perception components, and the NN controller. To this end, this paper presents NNLander-VeriF, a framework to verify vision-based NN controllers used for autonomous landing. NNLander-VeriF addresses the challenges above by exploiting geometric models of perspective cameras to obtain a mathematical model that captures the relation between the aircraft states and the inputs to the NN controller. By converting this model into a NN (with manually assigned weights) and composing it with the NN controller, one can capture the relation between aircraft states and control actions using one augmented NN. Such an augmented NN model leads to a natural encoding of the closed-loop verification into several NN robustness queries, which state-of-the-art NN model checkers can handle. Finally, we evaluate our framework to formally verify the properties of a trained NN and we show its efficiency.",

Our weighted extension of conformal prediction also applies more broadly, to settings in which the data satisfies a certain weighted notion of exchangeability. We discuss other potential applications of our new conformal methodology, including latent variable and missing data problems.},

Formal analysis of these systems is particularly challenging due to the complexity of the perception DNNs, the sensors (cameras), and the environment conditions. We present a case study applying formal probabilistic analysis techniques to an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using a perception DNN. We address the above challenges by replacing the camera and the network with a compact abstraction whose transition probabilities are computed from the confusion matrices measuring the performance of the DNN on a representative image data set. As the probabilities are estimated based on empirical data, and thus are subject to error, we also compute confidence intervals in addition to point estimates for these probabilities and thereby strengthen the soundness of the analysis. We also show how to leverage local, DNN-specific analyses as run-time guards to filter out mis-behaving inputs and increase the safety of the overall system. Our findings are applicable to other autonomous systems that use complex DNNs for perception.",

DNNs are hard to analyze due to their size (they can have thousands or millions of parameters), lack of formal specifications (DNNs are typically learnt from labeled data, in the absence of any formal requirements), and sensitivity to small changes in the environment. We present an assume-guarantee style compositional approach for the formal verification of system-level safety properties of such autonomous systems. Our insight is that we can analyze the system in the absence of the DNN perception components by automatically synthesizing assumptions on the DNN behaviour that guarantee the satisfaction of the required safety properties. The synthesized assumptions are the weakest in the sense that they characterize the output sequences of all the possible DNNs that, plugged into the autonomous system, guarantee the required safety properties. The assumptions can be leveraged as run-time monitors over a deployed DNN to guarantee the safety of the overall system; they can also be mined to extract local specifications for use during training and testing of DNNs. We illustrate our approach on a case study taken from the autonomous airplanes domain that uses a complex DNN for perception.",

abstract = {Conformal prediction uses past experience to determine precise levels of confidence in new predictions. Given an error probability ε, together with a method that makes a prediction undefined of a label y, it produces a set of labels, typically containing undefined, that also contains y with probability 1 – ε. Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for producing undefined: a nearest-neighbor method, a support-vector machine, ridge regression, etc.Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then the successive predictions will be right 1 – ε of the time, even though they are based on an accumulating data set rather than on independent data sets.In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled independently, other on-line compression models can also use conformal prediction. The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these.This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal prediction and works through several numerical examples. A more comprehensive treatment of the topic is provided in Algorithmic Learning in a Random World, by Vladimir Vovk, Alex Gammerman, and Glenn Shafer (Springer, 2005).},

abstract = {A central question in robotics is how to design a control system for an agile mobile robot. This paper studies this question systematically, focusing on a challenging setting: autonomous drone racing. We show that a neural network controller trained with reinforcement learning (RL) outperformed optimal control (OC) methods in this setting. We then investigated which fundamental factors have contributed to the success of RL or have limited OC. Our study indicates that the fundamental advantage of RL over OC is not that it optimizes its objective better but that it optimizes a better objective. OC decomposes the problem into planning and control with an explicit intermediate representation, such as a trajectory, that serves as an interface. This decomposition limits the range of behaviors that can be expressed by the controller, leading to inferior control performance when facing unmodeled effects. In contrast, RL can directly optimize a task-level objective and can leverage domain randomization to cope with model uncertainty, allowing the discovery of more robust control responses. Our findings allowed us to push an agile drone to its maximum performance, achieving a peak acceleration greater than 12 times the gravitational acceleration and a peak velocity of 108 kilometers per hour. Our policy achieved superhuman control within minutes of training on a standard workstation. This work presents a milestone in agile robotics and sheds light on the role of RL and OC in robot control. The fundamental advantage of reinforcement learning over optimal control lies in its optimization objective.}}

abstract = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",

In this paper, we study falsification of an automatic landing system for fixed-wing aircraft using a camera as its main sensor. We first present an architecture for vision-based automatic landing, including a vision-based runway distance and orientation estimator and an associated PID controller. We then outline landing specifications that we validate with actual flight data. Using these specifications, we propose the use of the falsification tool Breach to find counterexamples to the specifications in the automatic landing system. }

Our approach is to use a learned perception map that predicts some linear function of the state and to design a corresponding safe set and robust controller for the closed loop system with this sensing scheme. We show that under suitable smoothness assumptions on both the perception map and the generative model relating state to complex and nonlinear data, parameters of the safe set can be learned via appropriately dense sampling of the state space. We then prove that the resulting perception-control loop has favorable generalization properties. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach on a synthetic example and on the self-driving car simulation platform CARLA.}

The guarantees ensured by these controllers often rely on accurate estimates of the system state for determining control actions. In practice, measurement model uncertainty can lead to error in state estimates that degrades these guarantees. In this paper, we seek to unify techniques from control theory and machine learning to synthesize controllers that achieve safety in the presence of measurement model uncertainty. We define the notion of a Measurement-Robust Control Barrier Function (MR-CBF) as a tool for determining safe control inputs when facing measurement model uncertainty. Furthermore, MR-CBFs are used to inform sampling methodologies for learning-based perception systems and quantify tolerable error in the resulting learned models. We demonstrate the efficacy of MR-CBFs in achieving safety with measurement model uncertainty on a simulated Segway system.}

Perception contracts capture errors in ground-truth estimations that preserve invariants when systems act upon them. We develop a theory of perception contracts and design symbolic learning algorithms for synthesizing them from a finite set of images. We implement our algorithms and evaluate synthesized perception contracts for two realistic vision-based control systems, a lane tracking system for an electric vehicle and an agricultural robot that follows crop rows. Our evaluation shows that our approach is effective in synthesizing perception contracts and generalizes well when evaluated over test images obtained during runtime monitoring of the systems.},

The decision logic for each agent is written in a subset of Python and the continuous dynamics is given by a black-box simulator. Multiple agents can be instantiated, and they can be ported to different maps for creating scenarios. Verse provides functions for simulating and verifying such scenarios using existing reachability analysis algorithms. We illustrate capabilities and use cases of the library with heterogeneous agents, incremental verification, different sensor models, and plug-n-play subroutines for post computations.",

Our data is calibrated, synchronized and timestamped, and we provide the rectified and raw image sequences. Our dataset also contains object labels in the form of 3D tracklets, and we provide online benchmarks for stereo, optical flow, object detection and other tasks. This paper describes our recording platform, the data format and the utilities that we provide.},

This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem. [pdf]}

abstract = {We present an approach for the synthesis and verification of neural network controllers for closed loop dynamical systems, modelled as an ordinary differential equation. Feedforward neural networks are ubiquitous when it comes to approximating functions, especially in the machine learning literature. The proposed verification technique tries to construct an over-approximation of the system trajectories using a combination of tools, such as, Sherlock and Flow*. In addition to computing reach sets, we incorporate counter examples or bad traces into the synthesis phase of the controller as well. We go back and forth between verification and counter example generation until the system outputs a fully verified controller, or the training fails to terminate in a neural network which is compliant with the desired specifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over a suite of benchmarks ranging from 2 to 17 variables.},

abstract="This paper presents the Neural Network Verification (NNV) software tool, a set-based verification framework for deep neural networks (DNNs) and learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS). The crux of NNV is a collection of reachability algorithms that make use of a variety of set representations, such as polyhedra, star sets, zonotopes, and abstract-domain representations. NNV supports both exact (sound and complete) and over-approximate (sound) reachability algorithms for verifying safety and robustness properties of feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) with various activation functions. For learning-enabled CPS, such as closed-loop control systems incorporating neural networks, NNV provides exact and over-approximate reachability analysis schemes for linear plant models and FFNN controllers with piecewise-linear activation functions, such as ReLUs. For similar neural network control systems (NNCS) that instead have nonlinear plant models, NNV supports over-approximate analysis by combining the star set analysis used for FFNN controllers with zonotope-based analysis for nonlinear plant dynamics building on CORA. We evaluate NNV using two real-world case studies: the first is safety verification of ACAS Xu networks, and the second deals with the safety verification of a deep learning-based adaptive cruise control system.",

abstract="We address the problem of synthesizing a controller for nonlinear systems with reach-avoid requirements. Our controller consists of a reference controller and a tracking controller which drives the actual trajectory to follow the reference trajectory. We identify a type of reference trajectory such that the tracking error between the actual trajectory of the closed-loop system and the reference trajectory can be bounded. Moreover, such a bound on the tracking error is independent of the reference trajectory. Using such bounds on the tracking error, we propose a method that can find a reference trajectory by solving a satisfiability problem over linear constraints. Our overall algorithm guarantees that the resulting controller can make sure every trajectory from the initial set of the system satisfies the given reach-avoid requirement. We also implement our technique in a tool FACTEST. We show that FACTEST can find controllers for four vehicle models (3--6 dimensional state space and 2--4 dimensional input space) across eight scenarios (with up to 22 obstacles), all with running time at the sub-second range.",

    abstract = { We consider the problem of generating motion plans for a robot that are guaranteed to succeed despite uncertainty in the environment, parametric model uncertainty, and disturbances. Furthermore, we consider scenarios where these plans must be generated in real time, because constraints such as obstacles in the environment may not be known until they are perceived (with a noisy sensor) at runtime. Our approach is to pre-compute a library of “funnels” along different maneuvers of the system that the state is guaranteed to remain within (despite bounded disturbances) when the feedback controller corresponding to the maneuver is executed. We leverage powerful computational machinery from convex optimization (sums-of-squares programming in particular) to compute these funnels. The resulting funnel library is then used to sequentially compose motion plans at runtime while ensuring the safety of the robot. A major advantage of the work presented here is that by explicitly taking into account the effect of uncertainty, the robot can evaluate motion plans based on how vulnerable they are to disturbances.We demonstrate and validate our method using extensive hardware experiments on a small fixed-wing airplane avoiding obstacles at high speed (~12 mph), along with thorough simulation experiments of ground vehicle and quadrotor models navigating through cluttered environments. To our knowledge, these demonstrations constitute one of the first examples of provably safe and robust control for robotic systems with complex nonlinear dynamics that need to plan in real time in environments with complex geometric constraints. }

Static-time proofs of safety invariants, however, may be intractable for systems with distributed physical-world interactions. This is further complicated when realistic communication models are considered, for which there may not be bounds on message delays, or even when considering that messages will eventually reach their destination.In this work, we address the challenge of proving safety and progress in distributed CPSs communicating over an unreliable communication layer. We show that for this type of communication model, system safety is closely related to the results of a hybrid system’s reachability computation, which can be computed at runtime. However, since computing reachability at runtime may be computationally intensive, we provide an approach that moves significant parts of the computation to design time. This approach is demonstrated with a case study of a simulation of multiple vehicles moving within a shared environment.},

abstract="We show that symmetry transformations and caching can enable scalable, and possibly unbounded, verification of multi-agent systems. Symmetry transformations map any solution of the system to another solution. We show that this property can be used to transform cached reachsets to compute new reachsets, for hybrid and multi-agent models. We develop a notion of a virtual system which defines symmetry transformations for a broad class of agent models that visit waypoint sequences. Using this notion of a virtual system, we present a prototype tool CacheReach that builds a cache of reachsets, in a way that is agnostic of the representation of the reachsets and the reachability analysis method used. Our experimental evaluation of CacheReach shows up to 64{\%} savings in safety verification computation time on multi-agent systems with 3-dimensional linear and 4-dimensional nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft models following sequences of waypoints. These savings and our theoretical results illustrate the potential benefits of using symmetry-based caching in the safety verification of multi-agent systems.",

One way to address this is to exploit the large amounts of symmetry present in many real world designs. In this paper, we adapt partial order reduction for bounded model checking of synchronous hardware and introduce a novel technique that makes partial order reduction practical in this new domain. These approaches are largely automatic, requiring only minimal manual effort. We evaluate our technique on open-source and commercial packet mover circuits -- designs containing FIFOs and arbiters.",

abstract = {We propose a new probabilistic programming language for the design and analysis of perception systems, especially those based on machine learning. Specifically, we consider the problems of training a perception system to handle rare events, testing its performance under different conditions, and debugging failures. We show how a probabilistic programming language can help address these problems by specifying distributions encoding interesting types of inputs and sampling these to generate specialized training and test sets. More generally, such languages can be used for cyber-physical systems and robotics to write environment models, an essential prerequisite to any formal analysis. In this paper, we focus on systems like autonomous cars and robots, whose environment is a scene, a configuration of physical objects and agents. We design a domain-specific language, Scenic, for describing scenarios that are distributions over scenes. As a probabilistic programming language, Scenic allows assigning distributions to features of the scene, as well as declaratively imposing hard and soft constraints over the scene. We develop specialized techniques for sampling from the resulting distribution, taking advantage of the structure provided by Scenic's domain-specific syntax. Finally, we apply Scenic in a case study on a convolutional neural network designed to detect cars in road images, improving its performance beyond that achieved by state-of-the-art synthetic data generation methods.},

Feedforward deep neural networks are now widely used as a means for learning control laws through techniques such as reinforcement learning and data-driven predictive control. However, the learning algorithms for these networks do not guarantee correctness properties on the resulting closed-loop systems. Our approach seeks to construct overapproximate reachable sets by integrating a Taylor model-based flowpipe construction scheme for continuous differential equations with an approach that replaces the neural network feedback law for a small subset of inputs by a polynomial mapping. We generate the polynomial mapping using regression from input-output samples. To ensure soundness, we rigorously quantify the gap between the output of the network and that of the polynomial model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over a suite of benchmark examples ranging from 2 to 17 state variables, comparing our approach with alternative ideas based on range analysis.},

We evaluate all of these applications in an industrial case study on an experimental autonomous aircraft taxiing system developed by Boeing, which uses a neural network to track the centerline of a runway. We define runway scenarios using the Scenic probabilistic programming language, and use them to drive tests in the X-Plane flight simulator. We first perform falsification, automatically finding environment conditions causing the system to violate its specification by deviating significantly from the centerline (or even leaving the runway entirely). Next, we use counterexample analysis to identify distinct failure cases, and confirm their root causes with specialized testing. Finally, we use the results of falsification and debugging to retrain the network, eliminating several failure cases and improving the overall performance of the closed-loop system.},

However, it is hard to validate the testing outputs, because the oracle of testing is not always available or too expensive to get, unless the program throws an exception obviously. In the present study, the authors conduct a case study, where the authors apply a metamorphic testing (MT) method to detect the integer overflow defect and alleviate the oracle problem in testing critical program of Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Experimental results show that, in revealing typical integer mutations, compared with traditional safety property testing method, MT with a novel symbolic metamorphic relation is more effective than the traditional method in some cases.},

Metamorphic Testing has been successful to test programs for which a full oracle is not available or to test programs for which there are uncertainties on expected outputs such as learning systems. In this article, we propose Adaptive Metamorphic Testing as a generalization of a simple yet powerful reinforcement learning technique, namely contextual bandits, to select one of the multiple metamorphic relations available for a program. By using contextual bandits, Adaptive Metamorphic Testing learns which metamorphic relations are likely to transform a source test case, such that it has higher chance to discover faults. We present experimental results over two major case studies in machine learning, namely image classification and object detection, and identify weaknesses and robustness boundaries. Adaptive Metamorphic Testing efficiently identifies weaknesses of the tested systems in context of the source test case.}

abstract="Safety-critical distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have been found in a wide range of applications. Notably, they have displayed a great deal of utility in intelligent transportation, where autonomous vehicles communicate and cooperate with each other via a high-speed communication network. Such systems require an ability to identify maneuvers in real-time that cause dangerous circumstances and ensure the implementation always meets safety-critical requirements. In this paper, we propose a real-time decentralized safety verification approach for a distributed multi-agent CPS with the underlying assumption that all agents are time-synchronized with a low degree of error. In the proposed approach, each agent periodically computes its local reachable set and exchanges this reachable set with the other agents with the goal of verifying the system safety. Our method, implemented in Java, takes advantages of the timing information and the reachable set information that are available in the exchanged messages to reason about the safety of the whole system in a decentralized manner. Any particular agent can also perform local safety verification tasks based on their local clocks by analyzing the messages it receives. We applied the proposed method to verify, in real-time, the safety properties of a group of quadcopters performing a distributed search mission.",

abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have enabled data-driven controller design for autonomous systems. However, verifying safety of such controllers, which are often hard-to-analyze neural networks, remains a challenge. Inspired by compositional strategies for program verification, we propose a framework for compositional learning and verification of neural network controllers. Our approach is to decompose the task (e.g., car navigation) into a sequence of subtasks (e.g., segments of the track), each corresponding to a different mode of the system (e.g., go straight or turn). Then, we learn a separate controller for each mode, and verify correctness by proving that (i) each controller is correct within its mode, and (ii) transitions between modes are correct. This compositional strategy not only improves scalability of both learning and verification, but also enables our approach to verify correctness for arbitrary compositions of the subtasks. To handle partial observability (e.g., LiDAR), we additionally learn and verify a mode predictor that predicts which controller to use. Finally, our framework also incorporates an algorithm that, given a set of controllers, automatically synthesizes the pre- and postconditions required by our verification procedure. We validate our approach in a case study on a simulation model of the F1/10 autonomous car, a system that poses challenges for existing verification tools due to both its reliance on LiDAR observations, as well as the need to prove safety for complex track geometries. We leverage our framework to learn and verify a controller that safely completes any track consisting of an arbitrary sequence of five kinds of track segments.},

This paper proposes a novel approach to synthesizing neural networks as barrier certificates, which can provide safety guarantees for neural network controlled systems. We first propose the construction conditions of neural network barrier certificates, followed by an iterative framework to synthesize them. Each iteration trains a neural network as the candidate barrier certificate using the training datasets sampled from the neural network controlled system. After training, identifying whether the candidate barrier certificate is a real one for the neural network controlled system is transformed into a group of mixed-integer programming problems, which the numerical optimization solver solves with guaranteed results. We implement the tool NetBC and evaluate its performance over 6 practical benchmark examples. The experimental results show that NetBC is more effective and scalable than the existing polynomial barrier certificate-based method.},

abstract="We present a method for the computation of reachable sets of uncertain linear systems. The main innovation of the method consists in the use of zonotopes for reachable set representation. Zonotopes are special polytopes with several interesting properties : they can be encoded efficiently, they are closed under linear transformations and Minkowski sum. The resulting method has been used to treat several examples and has shown great performances for high dimensional systems. An extension of the method for the verification of piecewise linear hybrid systems is proposed.",

abstract="Despite the increasing effectiveness of model checking tools, automatically re-verifying a program whenever a new revision of it is created is often not feasible using existing tools. Incremental verification aims at facilitating this re-verification, by reusing partial results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for incremental verification that is based on trace abstraction. Trace abstraction is an automata-based verification technique in which the program is proved correct using a sequence of automata. We present two algorithms that reuse this sequence across different revisions, one eagerly and one lazily. We demonstrate their effectiveness in an extensive experimental evaluation on a previously established benchmark set for incremental verification based on different revisions of device drivers from the Linux kernel. Our algorithm is able to achieve significant speedups on this set, compared to both stand-alone verification and previous approaches.",

abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have enabled data-driven controller design for autonomous systems. However, verifying safety of such controllers, which are often hard-to-analyze neural networks, remains a challenge. Inspired by compositional strategies for program verification, we propose a framework for compositional learning and verification of neural network controllers. Our approach is to decompose the task (e.g., car navigation) into a sequence of subtasks (e.g., segments of the track), each corresponding to a different mode of the system (e.g., go straight or turn). Then, we learn a separate controller for each mode, and verify correctness by proving that (i) each controller is correct within its mode, and (ii) transitions between modes are correct. This compositional strategy not only improves scalability of both learning and verification, but also enables our approach to verify correctness for arbitrary compositions of the subtasks. To handle partial observability (e.g., LiDAR), we additionally learn and verify a mode predictor that predicts which controller to use. Finally, our framework also incorporates an algorithm that, given a set of controllers, automatically synthesizes the pre- and postconditions required by our verification procedure. We validate our approach in a case study on a simulation model of the F1/10 autonomous car, a system that poses challenges for existing verification tools due to both its reliance on LiDAR observations, as well as the need to prove safety for complex track geometries. We leverage our framework to learn and verify a controller that safely completes any track consisting of an arbitrary sequence of five kinds of track segments.},

Such reachability functions are useful for online monitoring, verification, and safe planning. NeuReach implements empirical risk minimization for learning reachability functions. We discuss the design rationale behind the optimization problem and establish that the computed output is probably approximately correct. Our experimental evaluations over a variety of systems show promise. NeuReach can learn accurate reachability functions for complex nonlinear systems, including some that are beyond existing methods.

abstract = {Affine systems reachability is the basis of many verification methods. With further computation, methods exist to reason about richer models with inputs, nonlinear differential equations, and hybrid dynamics. As such, the scalability of affine systems verification is a prerequisite to scalable analysis for more complex systems. In this paper, we improve the scalability of affine systems verification, in terms of the number of dimensions (variables) in the system. The reachable states of affine systems can be written in terms of the matrix exponential, and safety checking can be performed at specific time steps with linear programming. Unfortunately, for large systems with many state variables, this direct approach requires an intractable amount of memory while using an intractable amount of computation time. We overcome these challenges by combining several methods that leverage common problem structure. Memory is reduced by exploiting initial states that are not full-dimensional and safety properties (outputs) over a few linear projections of the state variables. Computation time is saved by using numerical simulations to compute only projections of the matrix exponential relevant for the verification problem. Since large systems often have sparse dynamics, we use fast Krylov-subspace simulation methods based on the Arnoldi or Lanczos iterations. Our implementation produces accurate counter-examples when properties are violated and, in the extreme case with sufficient problem structure, is shown to analyze a system with one billion real-valued state variables.},

abstract="Reachability analysis is a fundamental problem in verification that checks for a given model and set of initial states if the system will reach a given set of unsafe states. Its importance lies in the ability to exhaustively explore the behaviors of a model over a finite or infinite time horizon. The problem of reachability analysis for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is especially challenging because it involves reasoning about the continuous states of the system as well as its switching behavior. Each of these two aspects can by itself cause the reachability analysis problem to be undecidable. In this paper, we survey recent progress in this field beginning with the success of hybrid systems with affine dynamics. We then examine the current state-of-the-art for CPS with nonlinear dynamics and those driven by ``learning-enabled'' components such as neural networks. We conclude with an examination of some promising directions and open challenges.",

abstract = {Hybrid automata model systems with both digital and analog components, such as embedded control programs. Many verification tasks for such programs can be expressed as reachability problems for hybrid automata. By improving on previous decidability and undecidability results, we identify a boundary between decidability and undecidability for the reachability problem of hybrid automata. On the positive side, we give an (optimal) PSPACE reachability algorithm for the case of initialized rectangular automata, where all analog variables follow independent trajectories within piecewise-linear envelopes and are reinitialized whenever the envelope changes. Our algorithm is based on the construction of a timed automaton that contains all reachability information about a given initialized rectangular automaton. The translation has practical significance for verification, because it guarantees the termination of symbolic procedures for the reachability analysis of initialized rectangular automata. The translation also preserves theω-languages of initialized rectangular automata with bounded nondeterminism. On the negative side, we show that several slight generalizations of initialized rectangular automata lead to an undecidable reachability problem. In particular, we prove that the reachability problem is undecidable for timed automata augmented with a single stopwatch.}

Since rewriting logic is executable and is supported by several language implementations, our approach complements property-oriented methods and tools less well suited for execution purposes, and can be used as the basis for symbolic simulation and formal analysis of real-time and hybrid systems.

The motivation of having parallel algorithms is to exploit the computational power of multi-core processors to speed-up performance. The parallelization is achieved on two fronts. First, we propose a parallel implementation of the support function algorithm by sampling functions in parallel. Second, we propose a parallel state-space exploration by slicing the time horizon and computing the reachable states in the time slices in parallel. The second method can be however applied only to a class of linear systems with invertible dynamics and fixed input. A GP-GPU implementation is also presented following a lazy evaluation strategy on support functions. The parallel algorithms are implemented in the tool XSpeed. We evaluated the performance on two benchmarks including an 28 dimension Helicopter model. Comparison with the sequential counterpart shows a maximum speed-up of almost 7{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}on a 6 core, 12 thread Intel Xeon CPU E5-2420 processor. Our GP-GPU implementation shows a maximum speed-up of 12{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}over the sequential implementation and 53{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}over SpaceEx (LGG scenario), the state of the art tool for reachability analysis of linear hybrid systems.
