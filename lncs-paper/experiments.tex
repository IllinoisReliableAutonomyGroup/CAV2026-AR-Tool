\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:experiments}

We evaluate the Abstract Rendering Toolkit (ART) on verifying the robustness of a pretrained GateNet-based pose estimator in $4$ different drone racing tracks created in a 3DGS environment built using FalconGym~\cite{falcon}. The four tracks correspond to $4$ racing gates placed in a flying arena in different layouts: (1) a straight track, (2) a circular track, (3) a lemminiscate track, and (4) ??. 

\sayan{Describe the different inputs at an appropriate level of detail. Not all numbers need to be spelled out.}

\sayan{Show qualitative results with the 3Dplots}

\sayan{Main takeaways. What are they and how do you justify them?}

Future directions: Linear set representations for tighter bounds.
